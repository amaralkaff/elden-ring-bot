# Elden Ring Chat Bot

An AI-powered chatbot that provides answers to questions about Elden Ring using the latest data from multiple Reddit communities. The bot fetches information about game mechanics, builds, hacks, mods, and cheats from subreddits including r/Eldenring, r/EldenRingMods, r/cheatengine, and r/GuidedHacking.

## üöÄ Two Usage Options
