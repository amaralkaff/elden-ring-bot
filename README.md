# Elden Ring Chat Bot

An AI-powered chatbot that provides answers to questions about Elden Ring using the latest data from multiple Reddit communities. The bot fetches information about game mechanics, builds, hacks, mods, and cheats from subreddits including r/Eldenring, r/EldenRingMods, r/cheatengine, and r/GuidedHacking.

## 🚀 Two Usage Options

### Option 1: Quick & Easy (Recommended)
Uses Groq API for instant responses - no training needed!

### Option 2: Local Training 
Train your own model on Reddit data for offline usage.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add your API keys to `.env` file:
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret  
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="EldenRingBot/1.0"
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
```

3. Choose your approach:

**Quick Start (API):**
```bash
python web.py           # Start web interface
```

**Or train local model:**
```bash
python main.py          # Choose option 4 to train
```

## 📋 Commands

# Web Interface (Recommended)
python web.py           # Start web interface at localhost:8000

## 🔧 For Developers
